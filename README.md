# Smart Lyrics

Lyrics app sourced from Genius that allows users to download lyrics for an entire library for free. Built with Xamarin Android in C#. 

This is a personal project that I ended up making open source simply because I know I'm not the most capable person making this and because of some legal stuff with Genius EULA that could get this project shut down. If you'd like to contribute, please be aware of my newbie-level code and contact me through my e-mail (samu-rodrigues@hotmail.com) or GitHub account. 

## Features
This project started around July 2018, so the code was messy. I picked it up again in 2020 (this year) and rewrote most of it, and now only some features need revamping.
