SmartLyrics is a lyrics app sourced from Genius that allows users to download lyrics for an entire library for free. Built with Xamarin.Android in C#. 

This is a personal project that I ended up making open source because why not. If you'd like to contribute, please be aware of my newbie-level code and contact me through my [e-mail](mailto:samu-rodrigues@hotmail.com) or GitHub account.

## Features
This project started around July 2019, so the code was messy. I picked it up again in 2020 (this year) and rewrote most of it, and now only some features need revamping.
